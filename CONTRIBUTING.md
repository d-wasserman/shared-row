# shared-row-spec Contributor Guidelines
shared-row-spec is an evolving specification where early input is incredibly valuable. 

## Who can contribute
shared-row-spec is an open specification and anyone can contribute to its development. Because the shared-row-spec is intended to articulate a common series of formats and methods for describing the right-of-way, key stakeholders whose participation is encouraged are: 

* **Public Agencies & Staff:** As this specification will be used to provide high level understanding of cross-sectional databases for scenario planning and right-of-way allocations, public agencies would serve as both users and potentially maintainers of these unified right-of-way databases. 

* **Transportation & Planning Professionals:** As transportation and planning professionals will be beneficiaries of this specification, their input into what elements would be useful to track and what their needs would be is critical. 

* **Public Agency Software Partners:** Serveing as potential consumers and exporters of the this specification in order to ensure interoperability between applications that would benefit. The public agency software partners help ensure that shared-row-spec will connect to applications that help cities manage their right-of-way, communication changes, and test & simulate scenarios based on the description of the right-of-way. 

## How to contribute
Contributions should be offered through GitHub issues and pull requests. 

In general, you may open an issue or make a pull request at any time. We are currently early in the development stages of this specification so questions and input are appreciated. 

## What belongs in the shared-row-spec
The shared-row-spec is series of consistent database descriptions that enable cities to describe at a high level their existing right of way allocations and test their potential alternative futures. The scope for what this entails is to be limited to high level right-of-way allocations that can described in property-line to property-line slices of how a street looks and performs. Suggestions for database descriptions for corridors or intersections will be considered, but will try to be limited to descriptions that can be described in a table or json. This means the intended level of detail is to provide a shared-streets compatible line to node description of how right-of-way is assigned. 

## Code of Conduct
To encourage participation by any and all interested people, we aim to create an open and welcoming environment for contributors. We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**
