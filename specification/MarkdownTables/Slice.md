While the geometry can encode Z coordinates for absolute elevation; this attribute specifically for knowing the vertical height of surfaces relative to the street.

These lanes are considered to be center-running and can be bidirectional if they represent a block to block segment with end and begin depths for symmetrical intersection end points (no additional turn lanes on either end of the segment). Segments should be split if one block has varying turn lanes counts.                                                |
