# shared-row-spec
This is an open specification for describing the right-of-way (ROW) for a SharedStreets Reference. 
# Goal
The goal of this specification is to enable transportation professionals, urban planners, and urban designers to create a common database schema to describe the right of way.
# Objectives
The specific objectives of this specification revolve around creating a commmon specification built around SharedStreets and building a crosswalk between common centerline formats and OpenStreetMap.

These objectives can be identified specifically below:

1. Provide a common index based specification for describing sections of ROW using common descriptors. 
2. Describe a crosswalk that has a system of defaults built arounding taking existing data describing the ROW (OSM/Centerline Databases/Bicycle Facility Files), that creates default templates for ROW description that can be further edited and enhanced. 
3. Provide sample scripts and use cases that work across platforms (proprietary and open) so planners have the tools to build databases that conform to the shared-row-spec.
